Campus Connect - A Collaborative Learning Platform

## Description
Campus Connect is an innovative educational platform designed to foster collaboration within academic institutions. It serves as a centralized hub where faculty members and students can seamlessly connect and engage in collaborative learning activities.

The platform is structured into multiple modules catering to the distinct roles and responsibilities of administrators, Heads of Departments (HODs), teachers, and students.

At its core, Campus Connect serves as a dynamic and inclusive digital ecosystem fostering a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement. By providing a centralized hub for communication and resource management, Campus Connect empowers users at all levels—administrators, Heads of Departments (HODs), teachers, and students—to connect and collaborate in meaningful ways.
